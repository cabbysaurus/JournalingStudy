  <p>Thank you for participating in our study! Please note that you must use Google Chrome for the study to work correctly. Additionally you must have either 
  an internal or external microphone that works with your computer.</p>     
  <p>This study explores the language used and short-term benefits of online journaling systems. Although we aim to avoid asking intimate questions, it 
  is possible that your responses will include content that is personal to you. The information and journal text collected will not be shared with anyone
  outside of the two researchers conducting this study. It will be stored in a secure Google Sheet that is hidden to everyone except for the two researchers.
  </p><p>
  You may be asked to make recordings with your computer's microphone during the study. The voice recordings are not collected or listened to
  by anyone, including the researchers. They are simply transcribed using the webKitSpeechRecognition API. The text of the transcription will then be stored in 
  our secure Google Sheet. As with any online storage, we cannot assure you that your data is 100% secure. However, please be assured that we are aware of the 
  sensitive nature of online journaling and have taken appropriate steps to ensure privacy, security, and confidentiality. If you have any questions or concerns, 
  please feel free to <a href="mailto:acabral@g.harvard.edu?cc=hceballos@mde.harvard.edu">email the researchers</a>.</p>
